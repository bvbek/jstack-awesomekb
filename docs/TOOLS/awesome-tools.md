# Curated List of Awesome Tools!

This is an example of a MarkDown file that gets converted automagically to .rst by `m2r` module in sphinx. 

## Offensive Security

- **Hack the Box** (lab setup to test your red teaming and pentesting skills): https://www.hackthebox.eu/
- **BYOB**, create your Own Botnet. A fully integrated botnet in Python with the ability to load modules in-memory and a simple commandline: https://github.com/colental/byob
- **RunDotNetDLL32**, a tool to load .NET functions without using PowerShell: https://github.com/0xbadjuju/rundotnetdll32. An explanation follows (out of ![this blog post](https://blog.netspi.com/executing-net-methods-rundotnetdll32/)): 

::

    Below is a basic example command showing how to use PowerShell to load the .NET DLL WheresMyImplant.dll so that the DumpSAM() function can be executed to recover local password hashes.

    [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFile("C:\Downloads\WheresMyImplant.dll")
    [WheresMyImplant.Implant]::DumpSAM()
    [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Unload("WheresMyImplant.dll")
    As you can see, PowerShell can be a great medium for executing .NET methods reflectively.  However, this can become a bit cumbersome during testing and isnâ€™t ideal for executing client side.

    Enter RunDotNetDll32; this executable has one purpose, to duplicate the functionality of rundll32 for .Net assemblies. Syntactically it is very similar to rundll32.exe. For example, if you wanted to execute the pre-mimikatz trick of locking the workstation and keylogging the winlogon process, it would start with the following command:

    rundll32.exe User32.dll,LockWorkStation
    Where the syntax is:

    rundll32.exe $ASSEMBLY,$ENTRYPOINT $ARGUMENTS
    With RunDotNetDll32 the syntax had to be slightly modified to the following:

    rundotnetdll32.exe $ASSEMBLY,$NAMESPACE,$CLASS,$METHOD $ARGUMENTS
    For example, to run the SAM hashdump from WheresMyImplant you could use the command below:

    rundotnetdll32.exe WheresMyImplant.dll,WheresMyImplant,Implant,DumpSAM
    ----------
    Namespace: WheresMyImplant
    Class: Implant
    Method: DumpSAM
    Arguments:
